###### ABOUT QBOS ######

QBOS is a simple tetris clon I made in my free time, when I was young and
innocent (I publish this just to "not forget" :p)


###### INSTALL ######

* Windows

There's a setup.exe in http://games.softpedia.com/get/Freeware-Games/Qbos.shtml


* Linux

To compile this, you need SDL, SDL_image and SDL_ttf. In Ubuntu you have to install:

  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev \
    libsdl1.2-dev

Then, proceed with the usual spell:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install


###### KNOWN BUGS ######

- The movement of the blocks is a bit odd, you can't rotate a block when his resulting
  place will be out of the screen, that's why sometimes when a block is next to the
  borders it can't be rotated.

- Sometimes, the blocks can be moved after hitting the ground; this behavior is
  completely random xD.

- The Options screen permits the association of one key to two different movements
  without any error message.

- There isn't any validation in the input fields :o
